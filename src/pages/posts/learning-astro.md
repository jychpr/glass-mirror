## Why I do it?

I suddenly very inspired to create my own website. So I ask Google Gemini Pro to help me create and realize the website that I have in mind.
It has been a while since I wanted to create my own personal website, I had the vision in mind, but I don't make it real back then.
Now, I have done it.

### What I learn
1. Vision is nothing with no action
2. I learned how to take the leap of faith to make an action to do
3. Re-learn about website, HTML, CSS, especially the framework
4. Keep progressing forward, no matter what
5. Build first no need perfect, polish and make it better later time will do
